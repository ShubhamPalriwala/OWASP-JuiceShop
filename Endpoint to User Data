I had no clue about this challenge,

However, when i saw this in the Score-board, it had a reference link to the Monitoring System's Github tool.

Now, all i was looking for was a Url subpage, but did not find one on their Github Readme so i went to their main documentation.

There, i started going through one by one not thoroughly but just trying to find '/' in the page, lol.

On the second or third page ig, i found the /metrics and as soon as i used it in the Juice SHop, i got a ton of information and cracked the challenge.

I wouldn't have been able to do it if the reference link wasn't provided.
