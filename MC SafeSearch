NGL but i saw the hint as I had no clue for this.

Through the hints, i went to his Youtube Video where there were like 2-3 things which could've been his passwords.

Now, i tried so many of these and their possible combinations, that i was left with none ig.

Until this moment, i was entering because i thought that passwords couldn't have spaces.
Now i tried one with a Space in between and it counted is a character thus i knew this was also possible.

Finally, i cracked it with Mr. Noodles.

Mind the space.. lol
