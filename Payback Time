Here, I needed to place an order that made me rich.

I knew the poosible way was to somehow edit the quantity to a negative value.

I manipulated my cart items and found out a PUT request was being made to edit the details.

I used Postman and found out what I was looking for.

I added the quantity as a JSON object as -100 and Sent it.

I thought the challenge would have been done but I had to checkout in order to get it done.

Sweet and Simple Challenge.
