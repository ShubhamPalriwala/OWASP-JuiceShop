This challenge was comparatively easier than what I expected.

The Feedback form by default enters feedback either by your name (if you're logged in) or anonymous.

I inspected the elemented and after a couple of random tries and manipulations, found something hidden,
So after removing the Hidden attribute of it, another field appeared which lets you set the name of the user.

This was hidden completely, i entered any random name and filled the form.

The challenge was solved.
