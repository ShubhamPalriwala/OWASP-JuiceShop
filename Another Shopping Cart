So, i had no clue that i solved this Challenge.

Actually, i had a couple of Juice Shop homepages open and one had an account logged in while the other wasn't logged in.

Now i had to create an account for another user and after doing that, i added a product in my cart.

Now, i went to the scoreboard to see what challenge i'll be doing next.

So i decided to do the Cryptography one, for that i opened my initially logged in tab and went to the basket in it,

Suddenly, a header saying that i've just solved a challenge named as 'View another user's Shooping Cart'.

I think that the Session ID were different, and the website did not update it when the page reloads which is a vulnerability.

Unexpected success here..
