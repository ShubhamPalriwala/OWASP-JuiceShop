A Simple challenge to access Bender's account.

Found his email ID from the user reviews of products by going through them and then performing a simple SQL injection,
I was able to get into his account thus solving the challenge.

I dont know why this was labelled as a 3 Star challenge.

PS: The content is exactly similar to Jim's account as was the challenge.
