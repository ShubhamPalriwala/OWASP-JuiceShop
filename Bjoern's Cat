Found this challenge in the Score-board.

First went to the homepage wondering if I'd find something there. But did not :(

Then found something as a Photo Wall, when i went there, i found 3 photos, 2 loaded properly and one with an alt tag.

First, i tried to see what the Network tab had to offer, i thought i had something but is a dead lead.

Then i tried to inspect each element, and tried to load the unavailable picture,

Found it's URL in the inspect element but it could't load, figured it out quickly that it was due to the #' present in raw format.

Googled and found out that in a URL, '#' is encoded as %23 and the moment i changed them, i had the picture and boom the challenge was solved.

A dead end wasted an hour of me but i still feel that lead will haunt and come back again.
