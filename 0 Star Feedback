The first time i gave a random feedback and realised that all the field are mandatory as without the button just doesnt work.

I inspected the elements and found out that there was no specific required field in their html tags.
so it was clear that the Submit button had something.

I found out that it had a disable property which i disabled later xD,

The moment i removed the property, i was able to submit my Zero Star feedback hence the challenge was solved.
