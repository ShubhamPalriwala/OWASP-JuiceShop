This was the first challenge I solved.

When i opened the Juice Shop homepage, I opened my Developer Tools and selected the Network tab.
Then refreshed the page to figure out everything thats happening.

The first suspicious URL i came across was named as application-configuration.

I opened it where it had the app info and in the securityTxt, i found in acknowledgements a "/#/score-board"

The # was also a part of the home page as localhost:3000/#/ from where i figured out that this might lead me to the Scoreboard and it did.
