While registering a user, we were only asked to repeat the password again that meant we were supposed to manipulate it.

Now, i tried to inpect the elements and disabled the whole repeat password input field but it did not help,
as the form wasn't going through.

I tried entering different passwords expecting it to work i dont why and it failed obviously.
So now i tried random things such as trying to comment out the repeat password but it did not work too.

After like an hour, i first changed my password before changing the repeat password field (was just trying different combinations) and there was a surprise,
No different password warning was given,

I clicked the submit button and yes there i was completing the challenge successfully.
