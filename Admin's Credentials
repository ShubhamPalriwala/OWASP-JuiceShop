A pretty straightforward challenge to log in to the Admin's user account without performing a SQL Ijection or any other manipulation.

Here, the first step was to find the email id of admin.

I found it in the product reviews and luckily the first one.
Next, i tried to figure out from anything i could from his comments, but could't.

Now, i went to the login page with no clue of the password,
Tried a couple of passwords and then tried the default 'admin123' and boom it worked.

I think I got lucky this time otherwise i needed to bruteforce the password i guess.
