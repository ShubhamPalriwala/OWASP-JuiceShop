So, this drained me completely.

When I was choosing a challenge, I was looking for an easy or direct one thus chose this one as it was related to Provacy Policy.

Turns out, was a Bad choice.

Went to the Privacy Policy page and went through the Network or Inspect Element, did not find anything.

Then i was randomly going through the page and suddenly I observed some animation so inspected that element.

And to my surprise, Out of the whole paragraph, only this had a separate class.

I searched for the class and suddenly found out "localhost" mentioned as if it was some URL.

I went through all of the similar classes and managed to get something like:

http://localhostwemayalsoinstructyoutorefuseallreasonablynecessaryresponsibility

Now, this definitely was a URL, so I started to decode it.

The tough part was to try different combinations in how it worked.

I tried like 10 of them and was finally able to crack this out.

I think am not in any mood to take another challenge today now.
