So, I got lucky again ig.

In this challenge, we had to access the Store's Administration page.

I tried to enter in random URL's as i could not find anything in the application-configuration file or any others i tried on to.

So, after a few tries, i tried to enter '/administration' and surprisingly got a 403 Forbidden error.
Now i knew i was onto something.

I logged in the Admin's account and then went to the page and yes the challenge was solved.

Did not learn anything new in this so currently not satisfied.

Gotta do more.
