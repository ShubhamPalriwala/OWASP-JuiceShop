This was the second challenge I solved.

When i opened the Juice Shop homepage, I opened my Developer Tools and selected the Network tab.
Then refreshed the page to figure out everything thats happening.

The first suspicious URL i came across was named as application-configuration.

I opened it where it had the app info and in the challenges, i found something titled as xssBonusPayload and i realised that i might have just found something.

It had the XSS vulnerability.

To try it, i just gave a simple alert script and yes it had one.

Now i opened the Score-board just to find out what was to be displayed to solve this XSS challenge.

Surprisingly there were 2 challenges regarding this so both of them got done:
DOM XSS
Bonus Payload

And there i solved these challenges.
