The previous challenge i did was to upload a file >100kB which was the limit as mentioned in the front end.

Here, I used the same method that is, used Postman, and instead of the allowed .pdf or .zip file, i tried to upload an image i.e PNG file,

I was successful and the challenge was easisly solved.

Exactly same as the previous one.

Manipulating the request.
